## Goal
   The goal of this project is provide to all git users a program that lets them free of the git commands. We turned the old "cheat sheet" into an interface where users don't need to type in every single command to perform whatever they want with git. Users also won't need to "log-in" after the _push_ command, do it once and forget about it.
